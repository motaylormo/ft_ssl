This is my version of the **[42](https://www.42.us.org/)** cadet projects `ft_ssl_md5` and `ft_ssl_des` from the encryption branch.

# ft_ssl
Recoding parts of OpenSSL. In `C`. Cryptographic hashing algorithms MD5, SHA-256, SHA-224, SHA-1, SHA-512, and SHA-384. DES, both ECB and CBC. Made to run on little-endian machines.

See the **[hashing README](./README_hashing.md)** and **[des README](./README_des.md)** for the documentation, because they're both rather lengthy.
